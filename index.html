    <h1>Welcome to my website! 🟄 </h1>
    <p><i>Greetings, human visitors! Take me to your leader... 👽</i></p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm working towards a research career in the <b>biological sciences</b>, and I've almost finished my undergraduate course. Despite this, I still care a lot about space and I hope to specialise in <b>astrobiology</b> later on. I do music, mostly in the classical and folk spaces right now. I used to do Minecraft modding but I don't really have the passion for it now. </p>
    <h2>Plans for this site</h2>
    <p>I don't have time to work on it now, but at some point the blog page will be set up and the whole site will have some nicer formatting. :)</p>
