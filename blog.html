    <h2>My relationship with technology</h2>
    <i>12/12/2025, c.a. 02:30</i>
    <p>As a teenager, I was excited about new technology. I was always looking forward to using the latest new thing! I don't think that's true anymore. As I've been slowly trying to organise my life over the last few years, I keep finding ways in which they're holding me back. In general, I still believe in the project of improving our quality of life through technology, and I'd probably still call myself a futurist; my issue is with the way it's implemented in society, never the innovation itself. Computers and the internet still hold a vital place in my life, and they can still help me, but I'm having to filter out all the sources of <b>attentional capture</b> to make them work for me. There is an intentionality to my choice of technology now, so maybe that's just part of growing up? </p>
    <p>I apply high- or low-tech solutions varyingly throughout my life:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Phone</b> 🖁 I use a <a href="https://www.sonimtech.com/products/phones/xp3plus">flip phone</a> to reduce distractions, but it's not exactly old tech as it runs a locked-down version of android. This allows me to sideload what I need, but using apps is clunky and discourages me from spending too much time on my phone.</li>
        <li><b>Maps</b> 🗺 I've gone back on this one, I pretty much only use paper maps. I live in a small city that I know quite well, and over time my navigation skills have massively improved. It's given me a sense of relative distance, but when I used digital maps I would just aimlessly track from A to B like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_and_Bubble">that one Doctor Who episode</a>. </li>
        <li><b>Music & TV</b> 📾  &quot;<a href="https://tinkerbetter.tube/w/ns3WDZZgAoe1SfrDCAUrni">I stream nothing, and I am happy.</a>&quot; Ever since I set up my <a href="https://jellyfin.org">own media server</a>, I haven't really needed streaming services, particularly for music where I get everything by ripping CDs or downloading FLACs from the internet. I don't even really need the server for that as it all fits on a 128GB SD card on my phone - now <i>that</i> is a helpful modern technology!</li>
    </ul>
